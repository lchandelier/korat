# Korat
This package contains a base structure to start a front-end project.

It's called Korat because I'm a crazycat lady and a Korat cat is as small as this starterkit :)

It uses Gulp and Sass.

The gulpfile tasks allow you to:

 * Compress and concatenate SCSS
 * Compress and concatenate JS
 * Generate sourcemaps for each CSS/JS files
 * Optimize images
 * Create an SVG sprite usable inline
 * Include HTML parts (like header/footer...)
 * Reload your browser at each code update
 * Check for accessibility issues
 * Create a clean delivery zip of your project

## Installation
1. Extract this package at the root of your project
2. Install Gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp` command
3. Run the `npm install` command to install all required node modules
4. Run `gulp` command.
5. Enjoy !

## Usage

### HTML
The editable HTML (your page template like home.html, contact.html) are in **site/html**  
The included HTML parts (header, footer, everything common to all pages) are in **site/inc**  
The HTML template you create have to be placed in **site/html**.  
A mix will be made with the included files and the result will be generated at the root of the project.

You can refer to **site/html/index.html** as an example

### Sprites

1. Put your SVG icons in the "sprites" folder
2. Run `gulp sprites` command.
3. The sprite file is generated in **site/img/global** folder and the SCSS is generated in the scss/components folder
4. Call your icon like this: ```<svg role="img" focusable="false" class="unicorn" aria-label="Pink fluffy unicorn dancing on rainbow"><use xlink:href="#unicorn"></use></svg>```

### Accessibility check
Just run the `gulp axe` command. It will report all accessibility issues in your console and in the a11yResult.json file.
This file will be located in the aXeReports directory.
