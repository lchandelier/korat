# Base Front-end
This package contains a base structure to start a front-end project.

It uses Gulp and Sass.

You can choose between 2 versions:
With sprites or with icon font management

The gulpfile tasks allow you to:

- Compress and concatenate SCSS
- Compress and concatenate JS
- Generate sourcemaps for each CSS/JS files
- Optimise images
- Create an icon font based on SVG files
- Create multiple sprites with SVG and PNG fallback
- Include HTML parts (like header/footer...)
- Add [Fabricator](http://fbrctr.github.io/) in order to create styleguide
- Reload your browser at each code update
- Create a clean delivery zip of your project

## Installation
1. Extract this package at the root of your project
2. Install Gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp` command
3. Run the `npm install` command to install all required node modules
4. Run `gulp` command. 
5. Enjoy !

## Usage
You have to edit the gulpfile to change the urlSync variable (L.51) and the other paths if you need to.

### HTML
The editable HTML (your page template like home.html, contact.html) are in **site/html**  
The included HTML parts (header, footer, everything common to all pages) are in **site/inc**  
The HTML template you create have to be placed in **site/html**.  
A mix will be made with the included files and the result will be generated at the root of the project.

You can refer to **site/html/index.html** as an example

More doc here: [https://github.com/FrankFang/gulp-html-extend](https://github.com/FrankFang/gulp-html-extend)

### Icon font

1. Set a font name in gulpfile.js (search var myFont)
2. Put your SVG icons in the icon_font folder
3. Run `gulp iconfont` command. The font is generated in **site/css/font**
4. Call you font in CSS with @font-face.

More doc here: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-iconfont](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-iconfont)

### Sprites
As an example, 3 different locations are available (global, mobile, home). It allows to create a sprite for mobile, one for home and one for header/footer/whatever-repeats-in-all-your-pages.

It's useful to avoid too big sprites.

1. Set locations for sprites in gulpfile (search var folder)
2. Put your SVG icons **saved in tiny 1.1** in the folder your need
3. Run `gulp sprites` command (if you're not already use `gulp` command). The sprite files are generated in **site/img** folder
4. Call you sprite as the example provided in screen.scss.

### Styleguide/Fabricator
If you are on Windows, you may need to install Python 2.7.

If you want to add a styleguide to your project, just use the `gulp styleguide` command.  
It will untar Fabricator in the **styleguide** folder.  
To install it, you just have to be in the styleguide folder and launch the command `npm start`  
Every time you will update CSS/JS in your project, it'll be updated in the styleguide folder (by default in **styleguide/src/assets/toolkit**).
